ABOUT

This plug-in reads and writes the Maya IFF format in the GIMP (GNU 
Image Manipulation Program).  Only RGB format  files are supported,
with an optional alpha channel.

This plug-in will also read in zbuffer data from Maya IFF files. 
Maya IFF  files store the zbuffer information as 32 bit data.  This
plug-in normalizes that  data down into an 8 bit range and stores it
in an extra layer.  You WILL lose  precision. So, it is only
possible to read in zbuffer data.  It is NOT stored out again.

REQUIREMENTS

This plug-in is compiled on IRIX 6.5 for use with the precompiled
version of the GIMP that is distributed by SGI (see below).  If you
use any other version of  IRIX or the GIMP then chances are that
this plug-in will not work.

INSTALLATION

  1.install the gimp 1.04 package from the SGI freeware site 
    http://freeware.sgi.com
  2.copy the plug-in file "MayaIFF" to one of these
     two places:
          ~/.gimp/plug-ins
          /usr/freeware/lib32/gimp/1.0/plug-ins
  3.run the gimp
